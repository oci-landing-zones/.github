# OCI Landing Zones

Welcome to the OCI Landing Zones (OLZ) Community! OCI Landing Zones simplify onboarding and running on OCI by providing design guidance, best practices, and pre-configured Terraform deployment templates for various architectures and use cases. These enable customers to easily provision a secure tenancy 
foundation in the cloud along with all required services, and reliably scale as workloads expand.
